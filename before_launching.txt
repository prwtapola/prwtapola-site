Technical Checklist Before Going Live
1. Cross-Browser Compatibility
Test your site in all major browsers:
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
Check for consistent layout, fonts, colors, and features across browsers.
Ensure JavaScript functionality (like your hamburger menu) works in all browsers.

2. Responsiveness
Test your site on various devices and screen sizes:
Phones, tablets, laptops, desktops.
Use browser developer tools (Ctrl + Shift + I or Cmd + Option + I) to test different screen resolutions.
Verify:
Hamburger menu works properly on smaller screens.
Content adjusts to screen size without horizontal scrolling.
Images resize correctly (max-width: 100%; height: auto;).

3. Links and Navigation
Test all links and buttons:
Ensure internal links (e.g., /readings.html) and external links (e.g., social media) work as expected.
Verify navigation menu items direct to the correct sections/pages.
Check for broken links:
Use tools like Broken Link Checker or a browser extension.

4. Forms
Test all forms (e.g., Contact Us):
Ensure required fields work properly.
Verify submission and any success/error messages.
Confirm the forms send data correctly (e.g., to your email or database).

5. Performance Optimization
Page Load Speed:
Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix.
Optimize large images with tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim.
Minify your CSS, JavaScript, and HTML using tools like Minify.
Ensure CSS and JavaScript files are loaded efficiently:
Combine and minify files where possible.
Defer or load non-critical scripts asynchronously.

6. Accessibility
Check your site for accessibility:
Use tools like WAVE or the Lighthouse accessibility audit.
Add alt text for all images.
Ensure text is legible (good contrast between text and background).
Verify keyboard navigation works (e.g., users can navigate the menu using Tab key).

7. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Add meta tags to all pages:
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page.">
<meta name="keywords" content="relevant, keywords, for, your, site">
Add meaningful title tags for all pages (e.g., <title>About Us - Helping Our Community</title>).
Use proper heading hierarchy:
Only one <h1> per page, followed by <h2>, <h3>, etc.
Add a robots.txt file to guide search engines.

8. Analytics and Tracking
Add tracking tools (if needed):
Google Analytics for visitor tracking.
Facebook Pixel or other trackers for marketing purposes.
Test if analytics are recording data correctly.

9. Security
HTTPS:
Ensure your site uses HTTPS (install an SSL certificate if necessary).
Tools like Let’s Encrypt can help you get a free SSL certificate.
Prevent vulnerabilities:
Remove unused files, scripts, or commented-out code.
Disable directory listing on your server.
Ensure forms are secure (e.g., validate inputs to prevent SQL injection or XSS).

10. Backup
Create a full backup of your site before going live:
HTML, CSS, JS, and image files.
Any databases (if used).

11. Hosting and Domain
Verify hosting:
Ensure your server is configured properly.
Test the site on your server (e.g., via a staging environment) before pointing your domain.
Test your domain:
Ensure the domain is correctly pointed to your hosting server.

12. Error Handling
Check for error pages (e.g., 404, 500):
Create a custom 404 page for broken links (e.g., /404.html).
Test handling of nonexistent pages by entering invalid URLs.
Debug your site:
Open the Console in developer tools and ensure there are no JavaScript errors.

13. Favicon
Add a favicon to your site for branding:
Create a 16x16 or 32x32 .ico file and reference it in your HTML:
html
Αντιγραφή κώδικα
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

14. Final Visual and Functional Check
Do a final walkthrough:
Scroll through all pages to check for alignment, spacing, and any design issues.
Test interactive elements like buttons, animations, or modals.
